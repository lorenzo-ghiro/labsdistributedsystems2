### Recommended deadlines for the assignment


    Dear students,

    I would like to share with you this administrative reminder hoping
    you will find it useful for organizing well your studying activities
    and your preparation for the incoming exams session.

    The official dates for the 2 winter exam-sessions of our course are
    the 27th of January and the 17th of February.
    Please, recall that if you plan to have your mark registered for
    those dates, then I need to have your assignments ready for
    evaluation one week in advance. This means that:

    1st Winter session:
    Assignment deadline --> 20th of January

    2nd Winter session:
    Assignment deadline --> 10th of February


    NB: Meeting the above reported deadlines is just a suggestion that
    comes from me and prof. Montresor so to
    1) ease the bureaucratic process behind the registration of
    exams;
    2) let you plan your activities according to more precise dates;

    It is actually possible to deliver your assignment even after the 2nd
    official exam session and schedule the oral examination even
    later.
    However, in the last few years we have noticed that, not meeting
    similar recommended deadlines, few groups of students have not been
    able to ever finalize their projects, losing the opportunity to
    successfully complete the course.

    Prof. Montresor asked me also to inform you that, for those that will
    be able to deliver the assignment before the 10th of February, he is
    available for the oral examination in any moment even after the 17th
    of February (doing the oral examination either in his office or
    online).
    In this case he only asks you to send him your request of attending
    the exam at least 10 days before your planned day for it.

    I wish you all the best and good luck with the preparation of your
    exams,


    Lorenzo
